# Data Engineer Challenge

## Overview
Completed the items in: https://github.com/dtdataplatform/data-challenges/tree/main/data-engineer

## Pre-ramble
I didn't have a lot of time to fully write out this code. Hopefully, this is a good enough demonstration.

I also acknowledge the unit tests are lacking. I built out the framework so it can be
seen my approach, but writing all the unit test will take a bit of time.

## Executing
Initialize environment
```
make init
```

Run the code
```
make run
```

Check log.txt for output 

## Testing
To run all the unit tests:
```
make test
```

To run a single group of unit tests:
```
python3 -m unittest -v test.test_parse_xml
```
