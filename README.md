# Data Engineer Challenge

## Overview
Completed the items in: https://github.com/dtdataplatform/data-challenges/tree/main/data-engineer

## Pre-ramble
Development is a balance of design choices balanced with efficiency. Efficiency can be measured in development 
time as well as code execution time.

I could spend days refactoring and writing more elegant code, but sometimes 
we just have to call it "good enough" so I'm not spending days working on this
challenge.

I also acknowledge the unit tests are lacking. I built out the framework so it can be
seen my approach, but writing all the unit test will take a bit of time.

## Executing
python3 main.py

Check log.txt for output 

## Testing
To run all the unit tests:
python -m unittest -v

To run a single group of unit tests:
python3 -m unittest -v test.test_parse_xml
